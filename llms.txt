# llms.txt — gh-repo-settings (LLM instruction file)

This repository contains a GitHub CLI extension named “gh-repo-settings”.
Its purpose is to manage GitHub repository settings via YAML config
(similar to Terraform's plan/apply workflow).

Focus of this project:
- IaC for GitHub repository settings
- Commands: init, plan, apply, export
- Config resolution priority:
  1) .github/repo-settings/ (directory)
  2) .github/repo-settings.yaml (single file)

Key rules:
- This tool DOES NOT store or manage secret values. It only checks existence.
- Validation includes matching `status_checks` against workflow job names.
- `plan` must be a pure preview. No side-effects allowed.
- `apply` must apply only differences computed by `plan`.

Core YAML schema (simplified):
- repo: basic repo settings (description, visibility, merge strategies)
- topics: list of repo topics
- labels: items + replace_default
- branch_protection: keyed by branch, with review rules, status checks, deployments
- secrets.required: only names, values not included
- env.required: required environment variable names
- actions: permissions and allowed actions rules
- pages: GitHub Pages configuration

Project constraints:
- Commands must be idempotent.
- When both directory and single-file exist, directory takes precedence.
- For consistency, output YAML must preserve field names and ordering conventions.

Do NOT:
- Invent fields not in the actual schema.
- Assume secrets or env values.
- Modify GitHub workflow files; only read them for validation.
